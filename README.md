# Wazuh - Security Information & Event Manager Lab
## Ojective
This Lab project aims to further my learning about [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/about-us/) (an open-source SIEM solution). The primary focus is to ingest and analyze logs within a SIEM system, generate telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. 
This hands-on experience is designed to deepen my understanding and knowledge of Cybersecurity.

### Setting up Wazuh On-prem through a Cloud Provider
To have access on the Wazuh platform, you can either register for a [trial account](https://console.cloud.wazuh.com/sign-up) or do a manual installation.
For this lab, I use [Linode](https://www.linode.com/company/about/) to setup the Wazuh server, more detailed instructions can be found on [Wazuh's Quickstart guide](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/quickstart.html).
